Our goal at Burning Man is to provide a space where people can take ease in a relaxing environment that facilitates genuine connection with one another.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n              We would also like to balance out that relaxation with an opportunity to drop some wicked dance moves and turn that stranger on the opposite end of the dance floor into your new best friend.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n              We at Glåüm have curated an amazing relaxing space that we would like to open up to the public at Burning Man. We have a geodesic dome measuring 26ft in diameter, filled with diffused lights, cushions, music, and some truly incredible people.\r\n              We will hold readings and quiet performances throughout the day to accommodate a restful atmosphere. Passersby are encouraged to take cover from the sun and dust and close their eyes as one of our members reads from a saucy romance novel, narrates Shakespearean Star Wars, or recites some Victorian poetry. The tone of the performances is whimsical, silly and relaxing.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n              It&apos;s an amazing space, and we take radical inclusion seriously. We believe everyone should be included in Glåüm. Radically.\r\n              This is why we make it a priority to recruit as many people to our lifestyle as possible. Everyone is welcome, and in fact strongly encouraged, to join Glåüm, and a Glåüm initiation ceremony is held at the end of the week.\r\n              We understand that not everybody knows about Glåüm. This is a problem. That is why members make it a priority to spread the good word of Glåüm to as many people as they can through their time at Burning Man.\r\n              Camp members are supplied with Glåüm pamphlets outlining Glåüm&apos;s literature, member testimonials, and, most importantly, the time, date and location of our Glåüm initiation ceremony.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n              Those interested in accepting Glåüm into their hearts and joining our community are invited to recite their Glåüm vows at our ceremony. Once the initiation is complete, there will be a post-initiation dance party to celebrate the joining of our new brethren.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n              The post-initiation party will be complete with a set of Glåüm&apos;s most notorious DJs, and there will be a bar serving Glåüm&apos;s signature cocktail.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <br />\r\n          <br />\r\n\r\n          <h2 className=\"mb-8 text-center xs:w-10/12 lg:w-auto text-xl sm:text-5xl mx-auto main-headline font-normal leading-snug\" style={{ fontFamily: 'tokyo_dreamsregular', color: '#8B6914' }}>\r\n            The Word of Glåüm\r\n          </h2>\r\n          \r\n          <div className=\"text-center mb-8\">\r\n            <span style={{ fontFamily: 'tokyo_dreamsregular' }}>•••</span>\r\n          </div>\r\n          \r\n          <div className=\"mb-8 text-left\">\r\n            <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n              The world is a complicated place. We are constantly faced with so many options and decisions, it can be hard to know what is glåüm and what is wrong. So many struggle to find meaning, value, and a sense of completion. This is why our members are always trying to help others find their way to Glåüm.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n          \r\n          <div className=\"text-center mt-12\">\r\n            <h4 style={{ fontFamily: 'tokyo_dreamsregular' }}>\r\n              ˚ ˚ ˚  Glåüm ˚ ˚ ˚\r\n            </h4>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\n"],"names":[],"mappings":"8LAAe,SAAS,IACtB,MACE,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,MAAA,CAAI,UAAU,eAAe,MAAO,CAAE,SAAU,QAAS,WACxD,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,MAAA,CAAI,UAAU,wEACb,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,IAAA,EAAC,MAAA,CAAI,UAAU,sCACb,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,KAAA,CAAG,UAAU,2GAA2G,MAAO,CAAE,WAAY,sBAAuB,MAAO,SAAU,WAAG,oCAIzL,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,MAAA,CAAI,UAAU,4BACb,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,OAAA,CAAK,MAAO,CAAE,WAAY,qBAAsB,WAAG,UAGtD,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,IAAA,EAAC,MAAA,CAAI,UAAU,2BACb,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,IAAA,CAAE,UAAU,gBAAO,iOAGpB,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,IAAA,CAAE,UAAU,gBAAO,mMAGpB,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,IAAA,CAAE,UAAU,gBAAO,ymBAIpB,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,IAAA,CAAE,UAAU,gBAAO,suBAMpB,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,IAAA,CAAE,UAAU,gBAAO,uQAGpB,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,IAAA,CAAE,UAAU,gBAAO,wJAKtB,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,KAAA,CAAA,GACD,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,KAAA,CAAA,GAED,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,KAAA,CAAG,UAAU,2GAA2G,MAAO,CAAE,WAAY,sBAAuB,MAAO,SAAU,WAAG,sBAIzL,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,MAAA,CAAI,UAAU,4BACb,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,OAAA,CAAK,MAAO,CAAE,WAAY,qBAAsB,WAAG,UAGtD,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,MAAA,CAAI,UAAU,0BACb,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,IAAA,CAAE,UAAU,gBAAO,kTAKtB,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,MAAA,CAAI,UAAU,6BACb,CAAA,EAAA,EAAA,GAAA,EAAC,KAAA,CAAG,MAAO,CAAE,WAAY,qBAAsB,WAAG,+BAQ9D"}
